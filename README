The goal of the kernel is to be a modular kernel with an advanced virtualized 
file system where all resources are represented as files. Everything will just 
be streams of bytes their will be no ioctrl calls. The system also plans to have 
advanced features such as Union mounted filesystems, and dynamic filesystem 
namespaces. The system stated goal is to be able take a viriety of filesystem 
resources and then take them and make them all appear as one namespace as well
as allow user applications to beable to rearange their namespace as they see fit.
The system also strives to provide isolation between different sessions for added 
security. THe eventual goal is for the kernel to work as a distributed system and 
be able to scale to thousands of nodes.

The kernel is currently in the alpha stage and is undergoing active development.
Version 0.1 will be completed when the kernel can start paging, read a memdisk 
load it in to memory and execute a program on it. Until then it is in alpha of 
version 0.1.
